- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zuthos
- 👀 I’m interested in creating small games or projects to build my skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I have an associates in comp. sci. where I learned Java and C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment as my skills are too unrefined for me to feel confident in helping collaborate on something.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can email me at thinkingsharder@gmail.com if you'd like.
